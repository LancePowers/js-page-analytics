|---------------|---------|---------|-----------|----------|------------|
| Lecture       | Michael | Zach    | Zach      | Zach     | Zach/Reyna |
| Exercise      | Zach    | Michael | Michael   | Michael  | Michael    |

## Theory vs Practice

### Theory

1. More self-guided lectures - [example](https://github.com/gSchool/g11-course-curriculum/tree/master/week03/03_exercises/js-dom-basics)
1. Morning homework review (instead of diving into lectures) along with a mini-lecture/check for understanding
1. group whiteboarding - every group does everything, randomly pick which group presents
1. Student teaching/TAing to help solidify concepts

### Practice

1. Small pair programming exercises - refactor! refactor! refactor!
1. More coding time
1. Less large group exercises
