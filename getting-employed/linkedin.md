## LinkedIn

  - Change current job position to full-stack developer or web developer or some variation of that for a particular language
  - Clean clear smiling profile picture
  - All of your contact information filled out and cross-link all other profiles such as Stack overflow, GitHub, personal website, etc.
  - Remove any job positions held under six months that aren’t relevant
  - Make sure all job positions have a clear title, 1 to 4 sentences describing your positions and things you accomplished
  - Remove all skills that aren’t pertinent to web development such as Microsoft Word or the like
  - Add 10 to 15 skills related to computer programming such as JavaScript, Angular, HTML5, etc.
  - Ask your friends to endorse your skills, however do not ask them to endorse all of them because it will look strange if your profile has 15 endorsements from the same person get them to stagger them - one in three is a good ratio
  - Join 50 computer programming groups
  - Send out 25 requests connect per day to relevant people such as CTO’s, senior developers, or thought leaders in the computer programming world. Don’t bother sending it out to people that are not relevant connections
