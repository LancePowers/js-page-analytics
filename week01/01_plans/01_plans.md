## What makes a good developer?

* Resourcefulness - http://whathaveyoutried.com
* Passion

## Advice from previous gSchool students

* Ask a lot of questions
* Check your ego at the door
* Help others and don't be afraid to ask for help EVER!
* get comfortable with feeling uncomfortable/lost/confused
* Write a list describing the kind of developer you want to be and what you want to be an expert at(sometimes it helps to look at your dream jobs role descriptions). Make sure that you set aside a little bit of time every week to work on one small thing on the side that addresses that(whether itâ€™s reading about CSS mark-up or making a miniapp using a non-relational database, doing a one hour tutorial on how to use redis etc).
* my advice would be to not be intimidated, everyone starts somewhere. People that seem to know it all, knew little at first.
* it's important to actually do the homework. It helps to retain new information and gives you a chance to practice!
* when you run into a small bug that you think you can solve using trial and error, fire up a debugger instead and try to solve it in one shot.
* "the problem isn't solving the problem, it's figuring out how to finding the answer."
* Get sleep and take consistent breaks, ESPECIALLY if you feel like you're in a rut. You'll often think of a solution while you're taking a break, exercising, or waking up from a reasonable night's sleep.
* Don't just focus on learning syntax but make sure you understand the concepts of how mvc frameworks operate and pay attention to high level concepts. I would also throw in there to make sure to actively practice communication since lots of programmers do not know how to communicate or relate with people.
