# Week 2, Day 2

## Today's Goals

Students will...

1. Learn about JavaScript **data structures**, arrays and objects
  - Create an array using `new Array` and `[]`
  - Populate an array at creation: `var arr = [1, 2, 3]`
  - Populate an array using indexes: `arr[3] = 4`
  - Access elements in an array by index
  - Create and manipulate multidimensional arrays
  - Access the length property of an array
  - Explain that the length property always returns 1 more than the largest index
  - Explain that an array is an ordered set of values accessed by index
  - Explain that JS does not have an explicit Array type, but that arrays are just objects
  - Describe what an object is.
  - Articulate the difference between objects and arrays.
  - Create new objects
  - Get and set properties in objects using dot and square bracket notation. Explain the difference between the methods.
